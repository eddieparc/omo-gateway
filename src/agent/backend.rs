/// Agent backend abstraction for executing conversation turns.
///
/// # Trait Boundary Decision: Runner Boundary vs LlmClient Boundary
///
/// We define `AgentBackend` at the **Runner boundary** (`run`, `run_cancelable`, `cancel`)
/// rather than the lower-level `LlmClient` boundary (`stream_with_tool_calls`) for the following reasons:
///
/// 1. **Per-Turn Model Overrides**: The session context (`session.state.active_model`) determines
///    which model is used for a given turn. At the runner boundary, the backend has full access to
///    `SessionContext` to dynamically construct, select, or configure per-turn LLM clients or
///    route to specific backend workers.
///
/// 2. **Tool Definitions and Tool Filtering Flow**: Tool availability depends on session-level
///    configuration (`session.state.enabled_toolsets`). The runner boundary encapsulates the
///    filtering of `ToolRegistry` into `Vec<ToolDefinition>`, tool dispatch execution, output
///    truncation, status notifications to the dispatcher, and the multi-round tool execution loop.
///
/// 3. **Heterogeneous Backend Architectures**: Future backends (such as an external agent server
///    or appserver backend) execute their own tool loops and agent runtimes remotely. Placing the
///    trait at the runner boundary allows `SessionActor` to treat execution backends
///    and remote agent protocols uniformly without leaking LLM-specific details into the multiplexer.
///
/// 4. **Delivery Ledger & Lifecycle Integrity**: Cancellation (`cancel`), streaming token chunks
///    (`StreamChunk`), media directives, silence sentinels, and message transcript persistence
///    natively align with the turn lifecycle managed at the runner boundary.
